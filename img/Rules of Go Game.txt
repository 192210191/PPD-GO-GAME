                                    Rules of Go Game
1.Board & Stones

Go is played on a 19x19 board
(smaller versions like 9x9 and 13x13 are also used).
Two players: Black and White take turns placing stones
 on the intersections of the board.

2.Placing Stones
Black moves first.
Stones are placed on empty intersections and do not move once placed.
3.Capturing Stones

A group of connected stones is captured if all its adjacent empty points 
(liberties) are occupied by the opponent.
Captured stones are removed from the board.
4.Rule (No Immediate Repetition)

A player cannot place a stone that would return 
the board to its previous state from the last move.
This prevents infinite loops and forces players to 
play elsewhere before retaking a captured stone.

5.Suicide Rule

A player cannot place a stone where it would have no liberties unless 
it captures an opponent’s stone in the process.

6.Territory & Scoring

The game ends when both players pass their turns consecutively.
Territory: Empty intersections surrounded by a player’s stones count as their territory.
Final score = Territory + Captured Stones + compensation score 
(bonus for White, usually 6.5 points in standard play).
The player with the higher score wins.
7.End of Game

The game ends when both players agree there are no more beneficial moves.
The board is scored based on territory and captured stones.
